# BWA177
This is my CS177 bioinformatics course project.

### preliminary
I used the library called HSDS to support fully indexable dictionary. The library is built by Hideaki Ohno. To run my code, ypu should first install the HSDS library with the following codes:

```
$ cd cpp-HSDS
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ cmake .
$ make && make install
$ ldconfig
```
